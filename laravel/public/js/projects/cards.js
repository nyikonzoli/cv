    "This was a school project in early 2022 and we were working on it for about one and a half months. We created this project in a team of two and our task was to create a fully functional webshop, with an admin interface. The topic we choose is the webshop of an instrument shop.",
    "It is the final task that we have to do in our training. We had to come up with a somewhat unique idea. We could also choose the technologies that we wanted to use for this project. Currently, we are working on a site like Etsy.com but with some twists and unique ideas.",
    "I created this CV because I wanted to gain some more experience besides school, so hopefully I can start working in the industry much more easily. I had a lot of fun building this site and I learned a lot from it.",
    "I was intrested in artifical intelligence since I was like 14. I already used some libraries in python but I wanted to have a deeper understanding of this technology so I thought it would be a great idea to code my own neural net from scretch.",
    "This was an other school project"
